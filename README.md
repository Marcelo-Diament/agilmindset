## Presentation

### The Problem
###### Market competition is increasing exponentially and companies must be as close as possible to their customers to create and maintain a loyal relationship with them.


### The Solution
###### Deeply understand the needs and desires of customers, create solutions that meet each of the niches that make up our general public and generate perceived value for each given actions implemented.


### The Goal
###### The main objective of this project is to create a decision support tool that already offers a huge amount of data - already analyzed and segmented according to the applied data filters.


### The Idea
###### The idea is to achieve the goal by sharing ideas in order to discover new opportunities, weaknesses in processes and strategies (not only from the point of view of customers, but also from employees and collaborators). And will reward those who share their impressions and opinions, as well as habits and thoughts, with points that can be redeemed for credits.
